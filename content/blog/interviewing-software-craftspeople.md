When you’re looking to hire talented software craftspeople, the interview process plays a big role in their decision to join your team. It’s not just about assessing their skills, it’s also about showing them that your company is a place where they’ll want to work. Avoiding certain mistakes during the interview can help you attract the best talent and make them feel excited about the opportunity. Here are some common interview mistakes to avoid when hiring software craftspeople.

### 1. Don’t Act Superior

One of the quickest ways to turn off a skilled developer is by trying to make yourself seem smarter or more powerful. The goal of an interview should be to have a productive conversation, not to show off. If you act like you know everything or belittle the candidate, they’ll likely lose interest in working with you. Instead, treat the candidate like a fellow professional and be open to learning from them.

### 2. Skip the Brainteasers

Many companies have used brainteasers in interviews, but they don’t actually show how good someone is at the job. Questions like, "How many golf balls fit in an airplane?" won’t help you figure out if someone can write quality code or collaborate well with others. Focus on questions that reflect the real skills needed for the role.

### 3. Don’t Ask Questions You Can’t Answer

If you don’t know the answer to a question, it’s probably not important enough to ask. Googling tricky questions just to stump the candidate doesn’t make sense. Instead, stick to topics you know well and that are directly related to the job. This will lead to a better conversation and a more comfortable experience for both sides.

### 4. Don’t Embarrass the Candidate

Making a candidate feel embarrassed or uncomfortable during an interview is a big mistake. For example, criticizing their past work harshly or dismissing their ideas can make them feel undervalued. Interviews should be respectful and constructive. A positive environment will help the candidate open up and show their true potential.

### 5. Let Them Use the Internet

In real-world coding, developers often use the internet to research solutions. Blocking internet access during a coding test doesn’t reflect how they’ll work on the job. Let candidates use the resources they would normally have, so you can see how they solve problems in a realistic setting.

### 6. Don’t Make Them Code on Paper

Asking candidates to write code on paper or a whiteboard doesn’t show how they perform in real-world coding environments. Instead, give them a chance to code using proper tools. This way, you can see how they test, refactor, and improve their code over time, just like they would in the job.

### 7. Avoid Overusing Algorithm Tests

Unless your job specifically requires deep algorithmic knowledge, don’t make algorithms the focus of your coding test. Most software craftspeople deal with issues like design, testing, and clean code, not advanced algorithms. Use exercises that reflect the actual work they’ll be doing.

### 8. Limit Phone Interviews

Phone interviews can feel impersonal and rushed. They’re especially difficult for non-native speakers who might struggle without visual cues or body language. Whenever possible, opt for face-to-face interviews to create a more engaging and productive conversation.
