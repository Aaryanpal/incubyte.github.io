Uncle Bob says this very well in his book Clean Coder. And I will try it too! In the world of SoWs, contracts, and deadlines, one of the most common phrase software developers end up saying is "I will try"!

When a developer says this, he may mean "I will try, and I may not be able to deliver." However, it gets perceived as a promise of timely delivery.This is one of the pitfalls of being a developer. Accepting the deadline before knowing the details of what has to be done and saying "I will try". As a developer, one should strive to become aware of what will be needed for a task to be considered complete before making promises of when the task will be delivered.
