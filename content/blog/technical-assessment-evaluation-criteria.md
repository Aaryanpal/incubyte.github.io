The usual interview process at Incubyte is divided into 5 levels:

1. Pre-required learning
2. Call with the People Success Team
3. Technical Discussion with our existing team members
4. Technical Assessment
5. Software Craft Round

In this blog, we want to dive deeper into what qualities and key areas we look for in all the above setps, which is our technical assessment:

## Pre-required Learning
This step is there to help you through the interview process. Before we schedule the first interview, we ask you to go through 3 videos which will set you up for success, and we give you unlimited time to do so.

Here are the 3 videos we recommend: 
- Test-Driven Development: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U
- Software Craftsmanship: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c07uQGBZl0A
- Clean Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV079g7Irks&feature=emb_imp_woyt

In this step we will also shine light upon other skills will help you get through the interview process. Like Common Git operations, hands-on knowledge of your IDE and an understanding of a unit testing framework to name a few!

## Call with the People Success Team
In this step we aim to get on the same page with you about the role you are looking for and what we have to offer. Being remote-first also means that its so much more important that you and not just align on tech; but also on culture, attitude and core values! Our People Success Team are here to listen and help answer any questions you may have about the Company.

## Technical Discussion with our existing team members
A 30 minute discussion about your technical background. We want to know your experience so far and how well you know the things that you have worked with.

## Technical Assessment
A short offline coding test. We give you lots of time (unlimited) to take this assessment and send you resources and links that will help you clear it. Read further to learn about the things we look for in your submission.

## Software Craft Round
Congratulation! You have gotten to this round. Here is where all the fun happens. You will fire up you IDE with the langugae of your choice and get ready to get your hands dirty. We will solve a short Kata together as a team!

A few key factors we look for in both the Techncial Assessment as well as the Software Craft Round are:

## Technical

### Build tool like Maven or Gradle

Although most people work on projects where build tools are already in place, and most of the work relates to coding, we believe that build tools are first-class members of our development life cycle. Choosing the best build and dependency management tool when beginning a new project is vital and can go a long way.

### Clean coding practices

It is not possible to evaluate everything by a quick assessment, but below mentioned are a few key indicators waving the green flag:

### Code format

Code writing skills are essential, but so is code readability. A neatly formatted code has the power of readability.

### Amount of nesting in your code

Excessive nesting makes the code difficult to understand and raises cognitive complexity.

Applying best practices to your code:
Using clean code practices speaks much more of a personal habit as much as your coding skill. It can range from using the appropriate naming conventions to Page Object Models if you are working on test automation. Having some linters integrated into your IDE can help you adhere to the best practices.

### Commented-out code

Commented code is as good as a dead code. Version control systems, as well as modern IDEs, are great at maintaining history, code should not be kept commented with your current production code.

### Other attitudes we recommend

#### XP Practices

TDD, Pairing, Refactoring, working in iterations are a few practices we would love people to try. We take TDD to heart.

We do not expect everyone to be proficient at it, but learning and knowing about it will be a great plus. Preparing for the interview by doing a few Katas will help a lot.
BDD is a preferred method if you are programming for Automation Testing.

Consider one of the interviews as a pairing exercise, in which an Incubyte developer will partner with you and act as a navigator. It is fine to look stuff up on the internet.
We understand that having Maven or Gradle dependency coordinate on top of the code is difficult.
Heck, we may still have to google whether is it String.length() or String.size()!

Deadline pressure can result in unrefined code.
We should test our code before committing it in the same way as we review emails before sending them. After every iteration of passing test cases, it may not hurt to step back and refactor the code.

For us, XP familiarity is a bonus.

We are of the thought that productivity and sustainability go hand in hand.

Therefore, we encourage our teammates to keep learning and applying the knowledge. We have curated a blog on books you must read.

We also love to maintain a balance between personal and professional lives.
Life cannot be all work. Watch movies or binge on Netflix. Read your favourite books, write blogs if you prefer that, or even help in documents on GitHub if you love to. They are all an essential part of how we spend our time!

### Non-technical
Attitude, communication, ability to take and give feedback, how well you can use your IDE (read-shortcuts), ability to work as a team to name a few!

## To summarize it

The entire interview process is carefully curated by the HR, developers, and founders.
The motto behind such a detailed interview is to help us identify the interviewees’ technical skills as well as more intrinsic qualities such as principles, beliefs and values.

## The key pointers when we hunt for the best minds are

- Code should be logically correct
- It’s not just about completing the task, it’s more about the approach
- We are huge fans of clean code practices
- Simplicity and readability top the game
- Effective communication and the right attitude is as vital as technical proficiency

We look for a thirst for knowledge and passion for mastering your craft. If you think you have the perfect blend of skills and expertise for this, feel free to contact us at careers@incubyte.co
