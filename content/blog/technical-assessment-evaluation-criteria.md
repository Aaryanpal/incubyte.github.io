Title: Technical Assessment @ Incubyte

Incubyte is a combined effort of its team. Getting involved with us entails bringing your knowledge, curiosity, and authenticity to the table. The recruiting process plays a vital role here. Our interview evaluation criteria is specifically designed to scout the right people whose technical prowess, culture and mindset align with that of the company. 
We genuinely care about our core principles and values (Link to Why Incubyte blog here: https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/why-incubyte/). We are making constant efforts in creating a diverse and nurturing workplace while enabling a culture of constant learning and feedback. A place where each team member can thrive, be the best version of themselves while making steady progress in their personal and professional growth. Learn in detail about our hiring process here.
The usual interview process at Incubyte is divided into three levels:
1.	Technical Assessment
2.	Technical Pairing Session with our existing team members
3.	 Software Craft Round
4.	Final Round (if needed)
In this blog, we want to dive deeper into what qualities and key areas we look for in the first step above, which is our technical assessment:

Technical Assessment
A short offline coding test. We give you lots of time (unlimited) to take this assessment and send you resources and links that will help you clear it.
A few key factors we consider when evaluating your submission are listed below:
Using a build tool like Maven or Gradle:
Although most people work on projects where build tools are already in place, and most of the work relates to coding, we believe that build tools are first-class members of our development life cycle. Choosing the best build and dependency management tool when beginning a new project is vital and can go a long way.
Clean coding practices:
It is not possible to evaluate everything by a quick assessment, but below mentioned are a few key indicators waving the green flag:
Code format:  
Code writing skills are essential, but so is code readability. A neatly formatted code has the power of readability.
Amount of nesting in your code: 
Excessive nesting makes the code difficult to understand and raises cognitive complexity. 
Applying best practices to your code:  
Using clean code practices speaks much more of a personal habit as much as your coding skill. It can range from using the appropriate naming conventions to Page Object Models if you are working on test automation. Having some linters integrated into your IDE can help you adhere to the best practices.
A strict no to commented-out code: 
Commented code is as good as a dead code. Version control systems, as well as modern IDEs, are great at maintaining history, code should not be kept commented with your current production code.


Other attitudes we recommend:
XP Practices:
TDD, Pairing, Refactoring, working in iterations are a few practices we would love people to try. We take TDD to heart. We do not expect everyone to be proficient at it, but learning and knowing about it will be a great plus. Preparing for the interview by doing a few Katas will help a lot. BDD is a preferred method if you are programming for Automation Testing.
Consider one of the interviews as a pairing exercise, in which an Incubyte developer will partner with you and act as a navigator. It is fine to look stuff up on the internet. We understand that having Maven or Gradle dependency coordinate on top of the code is difficult. Heck, we may still have to google whether is it String.length() or String.size()!
Deadline pressure can result in unrefined code. We should test our code before committing it in the same way as we review emails before sending them. After every iteration of passing test cases, it may not hurt to step back and refactor the code. For us, XP familiarity is a bonus.

We are of the thought that productivity and sustainability go hand in hand. Therefore, we encourage our teammates to keep learning and applying the knowledge. We have curated a blog on books you must read. 
We also love to maintain a balance between personal and professional lives.
Life cannot be all work. Watch movies or binge on Netflix. Read your favourite books, write blogs if you prefer that, or even help in documents on GitHub if you love to. They are all an essential part of how we spend our time!
To summarize it:
The entire interview process is carefully curated by the HR, developers, and founders. The motto behind such a detailed interview is to help us identify the interviewees’ technical skills as well as more intrinsic qualities such as principles, beliefs and values. 


The key pointers when we hunt for the best minds are:
5.	Code should be logically correct
6.	It’s not just about completing the task, it’s more about the approach
7.	We are huge fans of clean code practices
8.	Simplicity and readability top the game
9.	Effective communication is as vital as technical proficiency 


Deviating from these key pointers lessens your chances of selection. We are a remote working organization. Therefore, the entire process of hiring the right person is important for us. We hope to find and add more gems to our team!


We strive for knowledge and consistent progress. If you think you have the perfect blend of skills and expertise and are the best fit for Incubyte, feel free to contact us at careers@incubyte.co
