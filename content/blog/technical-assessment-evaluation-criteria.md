Incubyte is a combined effort of its team. Working here entails bringing your knowledge, curiosity, and authenticity to the table. Our recruiting process plays a vital role here, and it is carefully designed to identify the right people whose technical prowess, culture, and mindset, all align with that of the Company.

We care about our core values ([Why Incubyte](https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/why-incubyte/)) and are constantly working to create a diverse and nurturing workplace while enabling a culture of constant learning and feedback. A place where each team member can thrive, and be the best version of themselves while making steady progress towards personal and professional mastery. Read on to know about our hiring process.

A typical interview process at Incubyte involves 5 stages:

1. Application (See our open positions here)
2. Self-paced, prerequisite learning
3. Call with the People Success Team
4. Technical Discussion
5. Software Craft Pairing

## Self-paced, Prerequisite Learning
Once your application is shortlisted, you will receive an email with a list of resources and short videos. This email is meant to help prepare you for the interview process and set you up for success. Suggested learning in the email is self-paced and there is no time limit for you to complete it - we're perpetually hiring!

Some of our favourites: 
- [Test-Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkblc5WRn-U)
- [Software Craftsmanship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c07uQGBZl0A)
- [Clean Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV079g7Irks&feature=emb_imp_woyt)

The email also highlights other skills needed for the interviews. For example, knowing common Git operations, hands-on knowledge of your IDE (with shortcuts), and an understanding of a unit testing framework to name a few!

## Call with our People Success Team
This step helps align your expectations from the role with what we have to offer. Being remote-first also means that it is important we're aligned not just on tech; but also on culture, attitude, and core values! Our People Success Team would also love to answer any questions you have about the Company, so ask away!

## Technical Discussion with an Incubyte Craftsperson
A 30-minute discussion focused on your technical background and journey so far. You can expect the conversation to revolve around languages, frameworks, and databases you have worked with; your prior experiences, projects, etc. This is for us to get introduced to the depth and breadth of your technical expertise. Here it is important that you have a good Wi-Fi connection since we'd want to have your video on during the discussion.

## Hands-on Pairing with an Incubyte Craftsperson
This round is where the fun begins! Fire up your IDE with the language of your choice, a simple Hello World program pre-installed, and get ready to get your hands dirty. We will solve a short Kata together as a team! Consider this round as a pairing exercise, in which an Incubyte Craftsperson will partner with you and act as a navigator. It is fine to look stuff up on the internet. We understand that having Maven or Gradle dependency coordinate on top of the code is difficult. (We Google things while working on production projects ALL the time - its the thought process that matters!)

This brings us to the end of our interview process. Expect to walk away with an offer once you have cleared all these rounds. We've even put together some additional information to help you crack it! You're welcome. ;)

The entire process can be broken down into two sections:
1. Technical
2. Non-technical  

## Technical
At this point we're trying to get to know your technical self better. How you code, think and generally vibe with the things that matter to us will be taken into consideration here. Let's start:
  
### Build tools like Maven or Gradle

We believe that build tools are first-class members of our development life cycle. Choosing the best build and dependency management tool when beginning a new project goes a long way in ensuring smooth project completion.

### Clean coding practices

It is not possible to evaluate everything during an interview, but here are a few key indicators that give us an insight into how you work.

#### Code format

Code writing skills are essential, but so is code readability. A neatly formatted code is readable.

#### Amount of nesting in your code

Excessive nesting makes the code difficult to understand and raises cognitive complexity.

#### Applying best practices to your code

Using clean code practices speaks much more of a personal habit as much as your coding skill. It can range from using the appropriate naming conventions to Page Object Models if you are working on test automation. Having some linters integrated into your IDE can help you adhere to best practices.

#### Commented-out code

Commented code is as good as a dead code. Version control systems, as well as modern IDEs, are great at maintaining history, code should not be kept commented with your current production code.

### Other attitudes we recommend

#### XP Practices

TDD, pairing, refactoring, and working in iterations are a few practices we value deeply and use on a daily basis. We take TDD very seriously.

We do not expect everyone to be proficient at all these practices, but knowing about the benefits and committing to master them is a great start. Preparing for the interview by implementing these practices on a few Katas will help a lot. BDD is a preferred method if you are programming for Automation Testing.

## The key pointers when we hunt for the best minds are

- Code should be logically correct
- It’s not just about completing the task, it’s more about the approach
- We are huge fans of clean code practices
- Simplicity and readability top the game
- Effective communication and the right attitude are as vital as technical proficiency

### Non-technical
Attitude, effective communication, the ability to accept and deliver feedback, how well you use your IDE (read-shortcuts), the ability to work collaboratively as a team, and a consultant mindset to name a few, are some qualities we look for in a future team member. A common thread that binds every single person at Incubyte is the passion to keep learning. We learn -> apply -> learn again -> again apply towards the goal of achieving professional mastery -> repeat perpetually. We believe that each individual owns their own career and is a lifelong learner. We have curated a blog on books you must read to this effect ([here](https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/books-we-believe-should-be-on-your-bookshelf-and-read-them-too/)) 

Life cannot be all work. Watch movies or binge on Netflix. Read your favorite books, write blogs if you prefer that, or even help with documents on GitHub if you want to. They are all an essential part of how we spend our time!

## To sum it all up

Our interview process helps us not only identify the interviewees’ technical skills but also their intrinsic qualities such as principles, beliefs, and values.

We look for a thirst for knowledge and a passion for mastering your craft. If you think you have the perfect blend of skills and expertise for this, drop us a note on careers@incubyte.co
