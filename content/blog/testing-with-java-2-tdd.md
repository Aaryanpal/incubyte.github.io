In the annals of software development, there exists a cautionary tale from the year 1996, when the European Space Agency (ESA) launched its ambitious Ariane 5 rocket. Alas, what was meant to be a triumph turned into tragedy a mere 40 seconds after liftoff, as the rocket met a fiery demise, along with its precious cargo. The cause of this catastrophe? A software glitch, specifically an integer overflow issue, lurking within the rocket's flight control system. 

The flight control software, repurposed from its predecessor, Ariane 4, failed to account for the vastly different flight trajectory and accelerated speed of Ariane 5. As a consequence, the program generated unforeseen numbers that exceeded the limits of a variable, causing the rocket to veer off course and meet its untimely end.

This catastrophic event highlighted the importance of thorough testing, particularly in software engineering. To prevent such incidents and ensure code reliability, Test-Driven Development (TDD) emerged as a powerful methodology. By diligently writing tests before implementing production code, developers can detect issues early, improve code quality, and avoid costly failures.  

Had the developers embraced Test-Driven Development (TDD) and diligently written tests encompassing various scenarios and edge cases, this calamity might have been averted. Through TDD, they could have uncovered the integer overflow bug before it wreaked havoc on the rocket's journey.  

This article delves into TDD, its step-by-step process, and the significant benefits it offers to the software development landscape.
