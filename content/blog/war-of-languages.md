For web servers or any general purpose production system

My criteria

* Static typing
* Compiled
* Good community support
* Good libraries
* Good frameworks
* Functional
* Memory management
* Easy (relatively not steep learning curve)

Static typing (Because error prone, Performance optimization)

Java, C, Rust, Go (sorry python and javascript)



Compiled (Performance, Memory)

Java, C, Rust, Go



Good community support (Don't want to be alone using the best programing language)

Java, C, Rust, Go, Python, Javascript



Good libraries (Don't want to reinvent the world)

Java, Javascript, Python, Go



Good frameworks (Library is okay but full fledge framework is required!)

Java, Javascript, Python, Go(Still evolving)



Functional (I am not a rigid OOP guy)

Javascript, Go



Memory management (Like they say, if you want to make a pie from scratch, you must first create the universe. C is good but Assembly is best. I need productivity.)

Java (Nearly there), Javascript (lousy), Rust (Awesome), Go



Easy (relatively not steep learning curve) (Need talent already knowing lang or can be learned easily)

Python, Javascript, Go



My choice

Go (easy, good syntax, static typing and compiled so fast, many libraries)

What I don't like about Go?

* Solid framework like spring.
* Module management (prove prove me wrong!)
* No generics (May be that is for good!)



Honorary mentions

Python: Easy

However I think pandas, numpy, jupyter notebook is the reason for python's popularity

Good to start but not good performance/memory wise in production

Contrary to popular belief I don't like python. Because you need javascript in frontend for sure, some compiled lang in backend for sure then why learn new language!

Huge respect though. Easiest to get started with. Not chosen because of I am searching for prod server language.

Java: Almost chose.

You go anywhere, you find java. You need to do anything, you can do it in java. Best thing, you don't need to depend on any other language like python/javascript is just a wrapper of C code

Not compiled. Still needs relatively higher memory - this is the reason I didn't chose it, bit slower then compiled - at least I have been told so

C: Best. But when I need a needle I won't use sword.

C++: Controversial. Linus doesn't like it. Anyways almost like C.

Rust: Awesome memory management.

Doesn't shine when need things faster - from my 30k feet view (correct me if I am wrong).

Also not good in frameworks.

Javascript: Never thought it would become so popular.

Easy.

You can do almost anything. Hugely error prone, lousy memory management

However bootstraping doesn't require too much memory. For simple programs it takes less than 100MBs as compared to java which requires 500MBs. Even if javascript requires chrome engine to work. I have chosen this for simple rest APIs or simple kafka consumers because of best time to market.

Not to mention almost best event based paradigm. Love it for IO.

Typescript: Huge fan.

Don't like because it is still compiles to javascript. Otherwise easy, great tooling, great community support. Great overall.

The day typescript will have its own compiler, I will use this.

Kotline, Scala, Groovy: What typescript is for javascript, these languages are for java

Clojure: Because Lisp. However not sure much. Still compiles to java!

C#: Java's brother (or Sister!). I am anyways opensource guy.

PHP: Are they still using it! Wordpress. If you remove wordpress never seen PHP anywhere. I don't think facebook still uses it.
