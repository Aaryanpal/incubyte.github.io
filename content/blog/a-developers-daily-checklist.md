Are you a software developer? How can you be more effective on this journey of being a craftsman? A lot has been written on this subject, but most focus on the big picture. But what about little things you can do to improve your daily work? All you need is 1% improvement to be on the trajectory of being a better developer and possibly a better human being.

## Did I think before naming my variables, classes, functions?
No matter how small it may sound, this one thing will make you and your teammates extremely happy. See, this is what makes you a better human being :-) you are already thinking about others, people who will read your code.

## Did I commit and push something?
Understandably, you can't push something every day. But as developers, we must strive to create stories so small that we can do commits and push every day. These practices will promote frequent releases, smaller changes, and lower risks. Of course, all of this works well if you have looked into our project kickoff checklist.

## Did I read a book?
You are consuming content all the time, blogs, videos, tweets, though books are different. It allows you to choose what you want to learn deliberately. Also, the book got printed and made in your hand, which may also mean the author has some authenticity on the subject and can deliver some value as opposed to some random tweet pushed to you.
Sure, you can not read a book every day, but we mean spending 10 to 15 minutes every day doing so. Once again, 1% investment in yourself everyday.

## Did you make a note
Wait, what! Notes? Isn't that something managers do? Yes, they do, but capturing the details of what you need to do, thoughts on architecture, or even an execution plan goes a long way. Numerous things come to our mind, either as part of team meetings or simply during showers. If you didn't note that thought down, then it will be part of those thousands of things you thought of but never got to.

## Did you create a diagram?
Creating diagrams can help you clear your thoughts in terms of software architecture or simply workflows. One more advantage, others can refer to it!

## Did I create an item in the todo list
Once again, as a developer, it's essential to be organized. There are a zillion things "you will do later." Make it part of your todo list, and then mark them off. Give Todoist a try. There is a rumor going that checking things off of your todo list releases Dopamine :-)

## Did I check my calendar
Checking and organizing the calendar along with your TODO list may be the first thing as you start your day. It's crucial in the world of remote working, there will be people waiting for you on calls, or you will miss something vital because you could not join a call. Make a mental note of how your day is going to look based on your calendar.
If your calendar is primarily empty, then go ahead and book your lunchtime on it!

## Did I automate something that I did three or more times
One trade-off of being a developer is getting caught in a spiral of monotonous, repetitive tasks. That leads to general unhappiness about your work. You have an opportunity to change that. Ask yourself, "Have I done this already three or more times?" If the answer is yes, then think about ways of automating it. Automation can range from sending emails to writing functions for code you find yourself writing more than a few times.
Believe it or not, you can send emails automatically by using Zappier or Microsoft Flow. We do it, and you should too!
