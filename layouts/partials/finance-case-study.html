        1. PROBLEM DISCOVERY
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        Our client has over 3.6 million unique loan contracts across various
        departments. Manually handling these contracts led to significant
        bottlenecks as the number of contracts escalated.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        The client also used a legacy CRM hosted on on-prem servers. This
        involved substantial maintenance costs for servers and a separate IT
        department.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        For every contract, important information was stored in plain text as
        memos. The cloud seemed the correct choice as the number of agents and
        contracts increased.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        As mentioned, manual errors inevitably started creeping in as agents
        worked on a contract and performed multiple actions, such as numerous
        clicks and data entries. Agents had to rework the same contract leading
        to a high turnaround time for a single contract.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        On close examination, this issue persisted across all the departments.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_2">
        2. CENTRALIZED SYSTEM TO ACCESS LOAN CONTRACTS
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        Before we partnered, our client had no centralized access system.
        Instead, the agents had to do multiple logins to different branch
        systems to find the correct contract and then log in to other workflow
        systems to work on them.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        The first problem we wanted to tackle was designing and developing a
        centralized system to access and work on all the contracts. This led to
        us developing the Customer Account Technology System or CATS.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Our approach solved the multiple sign-in problems; the agents would only
        have to sign in once to access everything from everywhere.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_3">
        3. ADDRESSING PRIVACY CONCERNS
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        As our client is a leading banking institution, they deal with
        customer-sensitive information such as PII (Personal Identification
        Information).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Since our clients primarily relied on on-prem servers, there were many
        concerns regarding the security of this data on the cloud.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Our solution was to design a cloud-based system that doesnâ€™t store any
        PII data. To address security concerns regarding the PII data, we
        decided not to keep sensitive data in our cloud-based application but
        instead on the existing on-prem server.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_4">
        4. AUTOMATING STATIC, REPEATED CHECKS
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        To solve the issue of high turnaround time due to rework and manual
        errors, we decided full-scaled automation was the best way to go.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Previously, agents performed manual checks to determine if the bank
        should proceed with a particular loan processing.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Bringing in automation saved agents considerable manual effort because
        the application now ran the static repeated checks on every contract to
        determine its state and subsequent workflow appropriately.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        All agents had to do now was perform the unavoidable mandatory checks
        using the application.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_5">
        5. INTUITIVE UI
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        While building out the UI of the application, there were internal
        debates within the client organization about introducing an entirely new
        system and disrupting the existing workflow.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Since the agents are used to fixed flows and interfaces, we quickly
        realized the importance of having a smooth user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        We found that 100% of our users use Windows. Therefore, we followed the
        latest design trends and patterns popularized by Microsoft to reduce the
        cognitive complexity and the learning curve for the new system. Hence,
        the users could experience the application like any other Windows app
        instead of a new alien system.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_6">
        6. LIGHTWEIGHT SYSTEM
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        Since this was a new product for our client, we designed it to be a
        lightweight system. As new requirements led to new features, we adopted
        an agile process where the deployment of the updated application can
        happen with the click of a button.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        By being truly agile about what we do and sticking to the frequent
        deployments principle, our release frequency has been two weeks on
        average for the last two years.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_7">
        7. THE ROAD AHEAD
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        One of the primary reasons for the productâ€™s success was the small
        self-sufficient agile teams working in tandem with each other with their
        customized scrum models. This resulted in high productivity and very
        rapid deployments.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        In the future, we are aiming to productize the application. Although the
        current product solves many client problems by saving time and effort,
        it is still a service product. The developers can only implement new
        features or updates.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        We are changing this by introducing small changes so users can change
        and update the product.
