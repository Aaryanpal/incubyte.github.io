        As our client expanded, reaching new and diverse clients became crucial. However, their applications weren't accessible to many potential users, including those with disabilities, creating ethical and legal concerns. This limited market reach and hindered inclusivity.

        We embraced accessibility as a strategic business driver. After a thorough audit, we tackled over 1,000 issues across the user experience, prioritizing the needs of diverse users:

  <h2 class="section-heading mt-5">A QUICK WORD ON ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
 <p class="label">ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS</p>
<p class="paragraph-body">
       Roughly 15% of the US population is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/24/8-facts-about-americans-with-disabilities/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20there%20are%20about%2042.5,care%20or%20independent%20living%20difficulties.">disabled</a>, and approximately 1 in 12 men are <a href="https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/#:~:text=Colour%20(color)%20blindness%20(colour,and%201%20in%20200%20women.">colorblind</a>. Stats like these frequently get ignored in the initial phase of a digital product because founders work against time and underestimate their possible success. But as soon as they have more than a few hundred users, you can confidently say that at least a few of them need a more accessible product. 
      </p>
  <p class="label">LEGAL IMPLICATIONS</p>
<p class="paragraph-body">
  Most Western countries have laws either encouraging accessible products or punishing the ones that are not accessible. Some such regulations and standards are:
      </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a>
    </li>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      This US federal law came to pass in 1990 and protects individuals with disabilities from discrimination. It mandates equal access to employment, public accommodations, transportation, and services. Violations of the ADA can result in significant penalties and fines, with penalties ranging from $55,000 for a first violation up to $150,000 for subsequent violations, depending on the nature and severity of the offense. 
    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>
    </li>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
    WCAG, established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), offers recommendations for crafting web content that is inclusive to individuals with disabilities. These standards guarantee that websites and web applications are designed to be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust, thus broadening access to online information and services. Additionally, penalties and fines for non-compliance can vary depending on the specific laws and regulations in a given jurisdiction.
    </p>
  </ol>
  <p class="label">BUSINESS IMPACT</p>
<p class="paragraph-body">
  Many governments and large organizations insist on using accessible products internally, which means if your target customer is one of these companies, your products will have to undergo some level of accessibility testing in order to sell them the product.

        1. Initiating an accessibility audit
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        To ensure the application is accessible to everyone, we used a tool called <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">Deque Axe DevTools</a> to check it thoroughly. This tool helped us find areas where application accessibility can be improved. Next step involved creating a list of tasks based on the findings from the check.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        After that, we went through each task one by one, focusing on the ones that would have the biggest impact. Doing this ensures that the application follows accessibility guidelines, making it easier for users to use and enjoy.
