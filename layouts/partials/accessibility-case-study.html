        1. Creating the approach
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        When building software products, content is often distributed across the
        application. Some are UI-embedded, while some come from the backend and
        the database.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Since language is a crucial aspect affecting user experience, we needed
        a proper strategy to retrieve content in the target language based on
        user location.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Our approach was to extract the strings of content, save their
        translations, and serve this translated version to the end user. To
        achieve this, we set up several steps in the frontend, backend, and
        database. We also made our solution user-friendly by translating emails
        and supporting right-to-left languages to enhance user experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_2">
        2. Tackling the Frontend
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        Every software product typically communicates with its users through its
        UI. Our first challenge was translating the UI based on the user’s
        language preference.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        The first step in tackling the UI-embedded content was to move it from
        code to simple text files. This helps simplify the process of
        introducing new languages in the future. A new language can be added
        simply by replicating the flat file in a different language.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        We used JSON files to separate code from the language embedded in it.
        Doing so ensures all content is available in one place, and a
        translation service can easily translate this content.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        In a global solution, there is a need for customized content based on
        the user’s location. In addition to generalizing common and hard coded
        content, helpline numbers are dynamically displayed based on user
        location to ensure users get the correct information.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Lastly, we introduced Crowdin, a third-party translation provider, to
        get translations for new languages. To extend this further, we
        integrated Crowdin with GitHub PR workflow so that the automated
        pipelines can handle the translations without a developer’s manual
        intervention, saving time for the team.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_3">
        3. Next Step, the Backend 
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        Maintaining consistency is vital in development, so we took similar
        steps in the backend to those in the frontend, ensuring a seamless user
        experience without disruptions.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        We configured the application to deliver localized content based on the
        user’s language preferences.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Initially, all content was retrieved directly from the database and
        passed to the frontend in English. As new languages were introduced, we
        made the necessary adjustments to the application to serve the
        translated data content instead.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        For translations, we opted for a hybrid of database and YAML files for
        serving translated content, using Crowdin as our choice tool for
        providing translations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_4">
        4. Solution for Emails 
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        Next, we also wanted customers to receive emails in their target
        language.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        In the case of emails, we integrated a third-party mail service
        provider, Iterable. Iterable offers smooth email translations thanks to
        its locale-based templates that automatically translate content based on
        the user's preference. For existing emails, we migrated them to use
        these easy-to-edit templates.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        In the future, our client's marketing team can effortlessly launch
        events and email campaigns with these editable templates.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        For our client, this meant a better overall experience. Mails are now
        translated and can be modified without a dependency on the developer,
        removing a significant bottleneck for the client's marketing team.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3 class="project-highlights-subheading mt-4" id="highlight_5">
        5. Support for RTL Languages
      </h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body mt-3">
        While the application empowered users to access content in their
        preferred language, supporting RTL language was the natural next step.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        For right-to-left languages such as Arabic, the UI usually appears
        mirrored. Based on this factor, we identified the elements that would
        appear mirrored to ensure an intuitive user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Bidirectionality is an integral part of the UI to support RTL content.
        An instance of this would be the direction of the arrow that indicates
        the back button in RTL languages. To accommodate this, we added
        bidirectional text and icons configured to mirror depending on the
        language needs.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        At the same time, content types such as images appear the same
        irrespective of language. For this content, we added smart exceptions as
        they don’t adhere to RTL styling rules. The same applies to specific
        icons that don’t hold directional meaning.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Overall, the steps we took, such as translating English to RTL language
        and UI mirroring, transformed our solution into a robust tool that met
        the diverse needs of each end-user.
